### Rob Wolff

You've stumbled across my personal site where I ramble and complain about tech stuff. By day I work at an IT consulting firm as a Cloud Services Engineer focusing on AWS and automation. By night, I fill my time creating -- I enjoy woodworking, cooking, wrenching on things with engines, and obviously all things tech. I currently hold 7 of the 9 AWS certificates which say I know stuff and I strive to learn new things. On this site you will find some of the tech oriented projects I I'm working on or have completed recently.
